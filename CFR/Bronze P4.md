POWER LAYOUTS  - BRONZE TRAINING - P4



Draft existing conditions and define demolition scope

Demolition backgrounds and walls should be dashed and bolded on architectural. Look at the PDF to see what they are removing. 

When adding your survey notes onto the drawing, be sure to put them on their layers (for example EP-EXIST). Put text on the layer dedicated for text (for example EP-EXIST-T). Put them on layers so you can freeze certain layers so that you can see a clean workspace.

STEP 1: Copy the layers from the CFR STANDARDS Electrical Symbols. 

STEP 2: Copy close by the new work symbols (choose scale) for easy access. 

STEP 3: The instructions ask for installing double receptacles into the office. Hence, copy the receptacle symbol and label it as "c" for computer receptacle. Take a look at the receptacle detail to see what that symbol stands for. Add convenience outlets as well (normally add them on the opposite side).

May be given requirements, like NEC 210.71 - Meeting Room Receptacles which tells you the requirements. They may say like you need one receptacle for every 12 feet of wall. (don't include doors) May ask for TV receptacle or projector ones (P).

One power whip per 16 seats.



## II. Layout corridors, restrooms, mechanical rooms, electrical rooms, and data closets

Break areas have a sink (water heater), countertop (rectangle), overhead cabinets (dashed rectangle)

Dashed could represent being above or below a counter top. Use elevation view to look at side view (vertical). 

Other symbols:

- MIC=microwave
- CM=coffee maker
- REF=refridgerator
- DW=dishwasher

## Requirements 

On countertops, receptacles required every 2 feet. (minimum 2 and on 2 separate circuits)

Ground Fault Interrupting Type (GFI) receptacles within 6 ft of water sources. Also use them for counter top heights.

Dedicated receptacles for MIC, DW, and REF

# Autocad

Don''t leave space under plan notes. Make sure the rectangle fits well.

## Kitchen

For **water heater**, use the J box with disconnect switch (always rotated so that the handle is on the user's right side pointing towards them; put rating) Put a circuit homerun (green arrow) to indicate the wiring that goes back to panelboard which means its getting is own circuit. Now, to let others know what these are serving, tag the corresponding number from plan notes. 

**Garbage disposals** are denoted with a motor. It needs a motor starter near by to control the motor. Show that the motor is controlled  by the switch by drawing arch between them. Put a circuit homerun. Tag it

**Dishwasher** put a receptacle with a G (GFI) to show its a dedicated receptacle. Add a homerun and a tag.

Show a convenient outlet by adding a GFI receptacle with a mounting height (+42"). If not specified it would be mounted at 18 AFF. No need for homerun because it does not need a dedicated outlet.

Certain things get dedicated circuits because they may take more  load and you would reach the capacity quickly. Put a homerun to show they are dedicated. 

## Corridor

One receptacle every 150 feet for vacuums. Regular receptacles.

Check if coolers require receptacle. Add a GFI type since it is a water source. Put them on their own dedicated circuits. Add tag. In plan notes add "Receptacle for  water cooler. Coordinate final location n field per manufacture's recommendation."

## Bathrooms

On countertop, add one or two GFI receptacle with +42".

## Mechanical Rooms

All receptacles should be GFI (G) and in weather (WP) proof enclosure.

Place one receptacle within 25 feet of mechanical equipment for maintenance tools.

**BAS panel** doesn't need a WP enclosure since it should be installed in the BAS panel enclosure. Tag it. 

## Electrical Rooms

Have a  receptacle near entry with EM (emergency).

Dedicated receptacle for **lighting panel** and one for **emergency panel**. Make plan notes and tag it.

## Data Closet/Telecom Room

One convenience receptacle per wall.

One dedicated for **security panel**.  Plan note: "Receptacle le shall by installed within security panel enclosure coordinate final location in field with security contractor."

Two double receptacle for **data rack** (draw square). Information will be provided by their IT. They might need certain receptacle. Needs dedicated  circuit. Plan note: "Dedicated quad receptacle for data rack. Coordinate exact location in field with it vendor"

# Circuiting

Put the homerun on the last device, and the rest gets the CRKT (circuit) numbers.

First, layout and then circuit.

# Code

Read the code at NEC 210.8.

Meeting room code  NEC 210.71.

The more you read code the more comfortable you get.

NFPA 70 (electrical code) is free

CFR login is in the book of knowledge.
