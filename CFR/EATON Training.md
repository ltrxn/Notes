# [Fundamentals of Electricity](http://www.eaton.com/flash/electrical/101series/Fundamentalsof_Electricity/story.html)

Everything is made up of particles called atoms, which consist of smaller particles called protons (positive), neutron, and electrons (negative). Electrons move from one atoms to another When electrons move between the atoms, a current of electricity is created.

Electricity is used to mean "wired for electricity", or a working connection to an electric power station. These connections grant the user access to the electric field present in the wire.

## Eaton

Eaton sells electricity and products that help distribute, control, and monitor electricity.

## Magnetism

Current flow from electricity will always produce magnetism. Magnetism is most commonly used in producing or using electricity. Magnetic influence can change the behavior of electricity. 

Electromagnetic principle led to invention of motors, generators, solenoids, tripping devices, and circuit breakers. 

**Permanent magnets** retain their magnetism after a magnetizing force has been removed.

**Electromagnets** only have magnetism when electricity is present. Stronger magnetism when iron is core is placed in the middle of a magnet (magnetize an iron rod by coiling a wire around the iron rod and connecting it to a battery). Electromagnetism is created by the interaction of electric current and a magnetic field. 

## Characteristics of electricity

Three main characteristics are current (I) , voltage (E or V), and Resistance (R).

Water flowing in a pipe can be an analogy for an electric circuit. V = water pressure, I = flow rate, and R =  pipe sizekeep resistance.

### Current

Current is the flow of free electrons in the same general direction from atom to atom. The current is measured in Amperes (amps or A) and is determined by the number of electrons that flow through a conductor's (like a copper wire) cross-section. 

### Voltage

Voltage is the force that is applied to a conductor to free electrons to make them flow and is measure din Volts (V). Current will flow in a conductor as long as voltage is applied. 

Alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) voltages are two ways voltage is distributed to homes and facilities.

With **DC**, voltage forces electrons to flow continuously in one direction through a closed circuit. Batteries and DC generators produce DC voltage and are used by IEC starters and power supplies.

With **AC**, voltage force electrons first in one direction, then in the opposite direction, alternating very quickly. This is the voltage generated by utility companies for homes, factories, and offices.

### Resistance

Resistance is the restriction to the flow of electrons through a conductor, measured in Ohms (Ω). There are four factors that affect resistance:

- Cross sectional area: when the cross-sectional area increases, the resistance decreases. For example, if area is doubled, resistance is cut in half.
- Material: amount of electron flow depends upon how readily atoms give up their electrons and accept new one. Conductors, like copper, silver, and aluminum, permit this (certain materials can be better conductors than others). Insulators are materials that don't readily give up electrons and restrict flow (rubber, glass, porcelain). 
- Length: the longer the conductor, the more resistance in the conductor. A two-foot long conductor would have twice the resistance of a one-foot long conductor. Therefore, length must be considered while deciding to use wire or busway.
- Temperature: as temperature increases, resistance increases. Transformers (temperature rise) and enclosed products must take temperature into consideration. This factor is not as predictable.

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory. It states that: *Voltage = Current x Resistance* or *V=IR*

Ohm's law is used to determine how much voltage is required for a certain load (computer, motor, or house full of appliances).

### Electrical circuit symbols

**Voltage symbol:** terminals of a battery are indicated by one or more lines. The longer line represents the positive terminal and the shorter represents negative:

**Resistance symbol:** represented in an open rectangle or zigzag line. They can also take the form of components like a lightbulb or motor (have unique symbols):

### Series and Parallel Circuits

**Series Circuit**s have their loads connected one after another in a series. If a conductor or load is broken, it opens the circuit, not allowing the current to complete the circuit.

**Parallel Circuits** have their loads connected across the power line to form branches. Each load operates independently of each other. A current has a number of paths to follow, so break in one branch does not prevent the line voltage from being applied to the remaining branches. If all paths are available, the current divides itself between the branch and back to the source.

# [Fundamentals of Electrical Distribution](http://www.eaton.com/flash/electrical/101series/Fundamentals_of_ElectricalDistribution/story.html)

Electricity is **generated** in the United States using coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, and hydropower. Alternative fuels are also popular. Steam turbines are used in power plants. Mechanical energy is changed into electrical energy by using the energy sources to heat water in a boiler to produce steam. The steam turns blades on a shaft turbine connected to a generator. The spinning turbine shaft turn electromagnets that are surrounded  by heavy coils of copper wire, creating a magnetic field which causes electrons in the copper wire to move from atom to atom, creating electricity.

Electricity is **transmitted** after the turbines generate electricity and step-up transformers increase its voltage. Electricity is routed to a network of high voltage transmission lines to transport safely and efficiently over long distances.

Electricity is **distributed** at electric distribution substations. Electricity is removed from the transmission system and passed through step-down transformers and distribution transformers to decrease its voltage. Then, it is passed through a home's electric meter into its network of electric wires and outlets.

## Electrical distribution system

Ensures safe and economical delivery of adequate electric power to electrical equipment.

1. **Radial distribution system**: Has one power source for a group of customers. One circuit failure means interruption for entire system. Most economical and widely used distribution system. Used for residential homes.

   <img src="C:\Users\Trxn\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200907224036474.png" alt="image-20200907224036474" style="zoom:50%;" />

2. **Loop distribution system**: loops through the service area and returns to point of origin. Particular placement of switches allows electric companies to power its customers from either direction. If one power source fails, switches can be opened to obtain electricity from an alternative power source. This enables utility to safely isolation and disconnect a portion of the system while maintain power delivery to other portions of the system. Provides better continuity, with only short interruptions during switches. Since it is more expensive, it is used for commercial buildings and shopping centers.

3. **Network distribution system**: most expensive, but reliable. Consists of a number of interconnecting circuits operating at the same voltage. A customer is connected to two or more power sources so that if one fails, another source will continue to provide power without interruptions. These systems are utilized in areas with high or critical demand like hospitals, manufacturing processes, and centralized computer installations.

## Characteristics

The most important part of an electrical distribution system are its relatively thin transmission lines/cabling. 

*Power = Voltage \* I (current)*

Power is equal to voltage times current. Higher voltage and lower current allow the diameter of the cable to be reduced. Also, power loss in a line is directly related to the current squared (power loss = I^2) so reducing the current results in a great reduction in power loss.

## Alternating Current (AC)

Generated by utility companies and transmitted to homes and business. The direction alternates 50 to 60 times a second. AC is created by an AC electric generator/alternator. Its advantage is that it can readily transform to higher/lower voltage levels using a transformer. The transformer uses properties of AC electromagnets and the power formula to change voltage.

There are two AC **power system types**:

- Single-phase system: the standard for residential service in the US. Uses three wires, two hot wires and one neutral wire, in different electrical combinations to provide different voltages. For example, one circuit can be made of one wire and the neutral wire to provide 120 volts AC, the amount required for lighting and small appliance. On the other hand, using two hot wires provides 240 volts, or the amount required by a clohtes machine.
- Three-phase system. Power is generated by rotating three coils through a magnetic field with a generator. Each phase is 120 degrees apart from each other and flows from the generator in a separate cable. These phases are delivered as a three-phase power or single-phase power.
  - Commercial and industrial facilities use three-phase power because it is efficient and runs smoother since each phase is 120 degrees apart, so the equipment does not see a zero point. Important when running motors because each new phase keeps the motor turning.
  - Two types of three-phase system: three-phase, three-wire and three-phase, four-wire. 

## System protection

The primary goal of electrical distribution system is to provide power with safety. System protection is designed to add equipment/conductor protection and service continuity at the most reasonable cost.

### Overcurrent

 is a current higher than the amount of current a conductor or piece of equipment can carry safely. When left uncheck, can cause insulation and equipment damage as a result of excessive temperature or dynamic stress. There are three types of overcurrent conditions:

- **Overloads:** a result of placing excessive loads on a circuit. Insulation deterioration in conductors is the result of overload conditions. If an overload condition exists, the temperature of the conductor increases and can damage/ignite the insulation. In a circuit breaker, an overload condition builds up heat and the circuit breaker opens to protect the cabling and, ultimately, house.
- **Short circuits:** also called faults, are caused by abnormally high current when insulation on a conductor fails. Insulation normally protects one phase from another or one phase from ground. A short circuit condition causes fire and damage to the system. 
- **Ground faults:** Ground fault currents are not large in magnitude so they can go undetected for a period of time. Occurs in electrical outlets near water.

### System coordination

Because overcurrent conditions occur in distribution system, thought has been put into properly coordinating that system. These three basic system of varying costs and continuity of service offer protection of electrical conductors and equipment:

- **Fully rated:** circuit breakers are rated to operate independently. They have an interrupting rate adequate for the maximum fault current available at their point of application. All circuit breakers are equipped with long time delays and instantaneous overcurrent trip elements to protect against short circuits and overloads.
  - Good for devices with ratings equal/greater than available fault current.
- **Selectively coordinated:** All circuit breakers are rated to interrupt the maximum fault current for their application. This system maximizes service continuity because only the circuit breaker nearest the fault operates to isolated the faulted circuit. Each upstream circuit breaker in the power distribution system incorporates short time delay tripping. These upstream circuit breakers must be capable of withstanding the thermal and magnetic stresses delivered by the fault current for the time period required by the circuit breaker nearest the fault to trip. Selectivity is based on magnitude of fault (current selectivity), fault withstand time (time selectivity), and both current and time (complete selectivity).
  - Most cost, but offers best overall protection and maximum continuity of service. Used hospitals, data centers, personnel safety, and critical process manufacturing.
- **Series rated:** The main upstream circuit breaker has an interrupting rating equal/greater than the available fault current of the system. The downstream devices connected in series can be rated at lower values. Both the main device and the downstream device would open to clear the fault.
  - Allows for lower-cost branch circuit breakers where service continuity is not as high.
