TELECOM AND SECURITY SYSTEMS OVERVIEW - SILVER TRAINING - T1

# TIA Overall

TIA = NEMA: Highly specific cold for various items

BICSI = NFPA/NCEES: Takes TIA code and makes it readable.

# Horizontal Cabling

This is what we do right now:

We don't specify cable drops and details. We normally put the pipe in the ceiling and that's it.

## Pathways

- Cellular floors are modular and able to segregate everything, access floor are not able to secregated (everything lays where they are) and they have air going through. These are often used  in data centers.
- Modular floors are great for government buildings as they are historic and they don't want to drill holes in walls and they are only 2 ft which is low profile.

# Cable organization

## Conduit Considerations

- Bends must be >90 degrees. An aggregate of bends in excess of 180 degrees between pull points or pull boxes
- Do not have continuous runs longer than 100ft
- No turning inside the box.![image-20201021124330389](C:\Users\Trxn\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201021124330389.png)
- Table 5.5 TDMM for number of wires per conduit. There is a formula for conduit fill calculations.

## J-Hooks

Should be located 5 ft apart at a maximum.

Suspended cable should be installed with a 3 inch clear of ceiling tile and support.

## Cable tray

Used when 50 or more cables converge

Types of trays:

Ask Phil for Cable Tray Fill Chart: includes how many cat.6 cables you can fit in a tray.
