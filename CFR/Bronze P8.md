PROJECT SUBMISSIONS AND QC CHECKLIST - BRONZE TRAINING - P8

# Project Kickoffs and Psych-out's

## Project Kickoff

Internal CFR meeting to startup the project. Project managers go over the "CFP Project Kickoff" document. This is the time for everyone to get a gist of the project and understand the scope of work.

Attendees: PM, EE1, EE2, ME1, ME2, BIM Manager 

Responsibility: PM Schedules the meeting and prepares agenda.

Document: CFR Project kickoff forms, RFP documents, existing drawings.

(A **RFP** is a "request for proposal". When the contract goes out, they request a proposal and CFR provides a price.)

## Project psych-out's

Comes right after to project kickoff. Individually held by mechanical and electrical teams. Design engineers meet with PE reviewers to brainstorm and plan out the design of the project.

Attendees: EE1, EE2, Electrical Reviewer and Supplemental Reviewer.

Responsibility: EE1 schedules the meeting and prepares the meeting agenda. They have to go through all the documents to understand what is going on. Should send out reminders to the reviewers.

Documents: CFR Project Kickoff Form, RFP Documents, Existing Drawings.

# Review Outline

1. Internal kickoff.
2. Psych-out meeting: engineers schedule meeting with all reviewers. Meet within one or two week of kickoff.
3. Survey. Done after psych out because the meeting may discuss different aspects that need a close inspection (like getting extra measurements)
4. Follow up psych-out meeting: meet up with the team to express any concerns and go over findings from the survey.
5. Mech/elect psych-out meeting: talk to mechanical after they've finished their own psych-outs. Get your parking spots (dedicate your space for major equipment). Get an general idea of what mech is planning to add.
6. Design.
7. Mech/elect coordination meeting: electrical engineer is responsible for scheduling meeting w/ mechanical engineers. This is where we look at the plans and make sure everything is accounted. Look through schedule and floor plans. After the discussion, go back and revise.
8. Reviews (1st and 2nd level): block out 1-2 hours.
9. Review comment meeting: schedule the meeting the day of or day after the reviews. Go through each comment as a team. Sometimes they aren't clear, so ask for clarification.
10. Mech/elect post review meeting: mechanical engineers establish what equipment they added so that electrical can make sure they are powered up. 
11. Submission
12. Repeat #5-#10 for each submission (15%-95%)
13. Final reviewer walkthrough meeting (100%/final)
14. Final reviewer.



# Project Schedule and Submission Levels

**15%** schematic: architectural concept drawings and narrative. Potential for MEP narrative depending on project.

**35%** design: schematic design stage w/ floorplans w/ existing conditions and anything needed to demo, major equipment layout, one-line diagram, and existing panel schedules. Think about distribution of electricity from birds eye. Find out if there's enough power with existing infrastructure through power layout, one line diagrams, and rough calculations. Submit spec TOC and BOD narrative.

**65%** design: Intermediate design stage starting with laying out furniture (like power data, fridge, receptacle), panel schedules, equipment and device layout should be completed and ready for circuiting. Major electrical equipment should be established.  Draft specifications and updated BOD Narrative are submitted.  

**95%** design. All major elements of design should be present with only non-essential finer remaining. All layouts, circuit, schedules, and load calculations should be completed. Complete specifications and updated BOD Narrative are submitted. (95% should really be close to 100% with everything in place and identified so that no major items need to be added here) Everything is absolutely complete. 

**100%** design: project drawings, specifications and BOD are fully complete. All tasks and prior comments are picked up and fixed.

Final/permit submission: all prior 95%/100% comments are picked up and ready to be submitted to the county for Permit. Takes a long time because it takes a lot of back and forth (around 1-2 months). Finer details are  added during this time. 

Issued for construction: all permit comments and additional details and coordination items related to constructability are project are complete. 

# QC Checklist

Schedule meetings on reviewer's calendar. 1Block out 1-3 hours depending on the size of the projects. When sending them the appointment, attach the documents.  At every submission, include the links to review documents and QC checklist (Save As>PDF) at every submission and these documents:

- QC Checklist
- Drawings
- BOD
- Specs

**Template:** Template to QC checklist: Electrical Team Book of Knowledge>Quality Control> (TEMPLATE) CFR - QA/QC CHECKLIST - ELECTRICAL. Copy and Paste the file and replace "(TEMPLATE)" with the project number. 

The **QC Checklist** is a checklist that includes a lot of things that are often forgotten. It ensures that every project has the same quality and mistakes aren't made. Helpful took to use *while* you are designing.

Cross out items that are not applicable to your project. For example, cross out "Obtained copy of the design builders cost estimate" if it's not a DB (design build) job, or cross out all the NIH requirements if it's not a NIH project.
