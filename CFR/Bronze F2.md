NFPA 72 (log in information in the book of knowledge), IFC Chapter 9, NIH has its own.

Book of knowledge>Design>Low Voltage Systems>"Fire alarm general" has all the requirements.

First strobe must be 15 ft from end of corridor. Can't have >100ft between strobes.

## Offices

No need for NAC in private offices.

In open offices, make sure everything is covered.

## Bathrooms

Bathrooms have visuals only ceiling mounted.

# Symbols

## Candela Rating

Different ratings means the strobe lights can travel so far.

Revit: check "Ceiling Coverage Visible"  to see how far a strobe can cover.

AutoCAD: if you want to see the coverages n model state but not in the actual space. Double click into viewpoint, and type "LAYOFF" and click the coverage. FA_COVERAGE layer should be turned off.

Put the rating in white text next to NAC. "WM" means wall mount.  

## Audios vs Speakers

A vs SP. A = just audio: can be horn or alarm. SP = speaker: can broadcast voice. 

 **Speakers** should be every 30 ft (similar to smoke detectors). Speakers have 15 ft radius. Must cover

# Smoke Detectors

S is smoke detector. SD is duct mounted smoke detectors.

 Only put smoke detectors in mission critical areas, like electrical rooms, storage rooms over 100 square feet, IT closets (maybe). No need for restrooms, conference rooms. 

# FACP/FAAP

Put the Fire Alarm Annunciator Panel (building layouts and shows where the trouble signals are) near the door with the address.

Fire Alarm Control Panel can be placed in electrical room. (NIH code says to put the control panel in the main lobby)

# Fire Alarm Pull Stations

 Put a pull station by all exit doors and stairs. If you have a pull station you should have a notification appliance within 15 feet.
