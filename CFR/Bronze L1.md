Lighting Systems Overview - BRONZE TRAINING - L1

# What is lighting

Primary Goals:

- Light Levels
- Controls
- Code Compliant

Secondary Goals:

- Aesthetics: Making sure it looks it good and comfortable
- Energy efficiency
- Select fixtures

You need to power and control the light. 

- Control through power line (phase control) or with auxiliary wiring (voltage wiring).

Light is electromagnetic radiation. It's a visible wave. There are different wavelengths we can see. What we see is the reflection of light.

## CRI

CRI is a rendering index that tells you how well a light fixture, LED diode, or fluorescent light renders color. A higher CRI means something is more bright. A bad light is not able to reflect off certain color values of the strawberry.

The minimum CRI is 90.

## Spectral Vallues

Different lights can render certain wavelengths more than others.  

Monochromatic like red won't disturb animal sleeping patterns.

## Temperature

CCT,or correlated color temperature, can be yellow but render all the colors.

3500 is for office standards in the US (all of NIH), Asia uses 5000-6000, 2000-3000 for hospitality.

Make sure to use the same temperature for a space.

## Maintenance factor

LEDs don't really "die" like fluorescents ad others do. They just get dimmer over time.

L70 Calculations: light is considered no longer useful 70% initial lumens.

Light loss factor of .85. If it's a really dirty room you can drop it down to .8 (makes it extra bright). This factor compensates for it being dim from time and dirtiness. 

# Lighting Plans

E200:

![image-20201013102838267](C:\Users\Trxn\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201013102838267.png)

Home run top left (*L2 12*) with **circuit** number *12*.

*L2* and *L13* is your **fixture** type. Reference the types to a schedule.

*S22A SQ8W* are complex **switches** (you might just have on and off).

**Control devices** include *OS* (optex sensor?), *QS*.



Lighting plans are E200 or E500. E500 is for specific control plans (not necessary in every project):

<img src="C:\Users\Trxn\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201013103333941.png" alt="image-20201013103333941" style="zoom:80%;" />

This E500 is E200 duplicated but circuitry is taken off. Shows zoning with arcs. *Z41-05* is a zone homerun. Circular *D* is a daylight sensor and the dash lines show which zones are controlled by that sensor.

A **zone** is a group of lights that are control together. It's expensive to control lights individually.

# Lighting Fixture Schedule

<img src="C:\Users\Trxn\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201013104601629.png" alt="image-20201013104601629" style="zoom:50%;" />



Letters to denote which fixture it is on the plan, and information to order it.

**Wiring Device** under the cover sheet will tell you a list of control devices. 

# Details

Details for emergency lighting, wiring details, controls details, legend details.

These are unique details made for Revit to show that these linear fixtures have separate control zones up and down. Tells the contractor that these are zoned specially.

# Code

Egress lighting is the biggest thing. Requirements in IBC and fire codes that talk about how much light has to be in the walk way and exit. Sets requirements about how bright your exit signs have to be and how far away should the sign still be visible. 

Egress pathway is the fire exit route. You have to make sure the entire path is lit, including the exit of the building on the outside!

Stairs have very specific codes. Partway up the stairs have to be 10 feet candles (only if egress stair).

Emergency lights are operated through generator or battery (there can be a battery built in or have one in the closet that powers them). Bug lights have battery built in (architects don't like this). Generator > built in battery (make sure you add it in details) > bug lights.



# More in detail

## Coordination

Make sure you coordinate with other things on the ceiling, or else you might end up having lights in a straight line except one moved over. Lights is often moved instead of the other fixture.

## Ceiling types

ACT acoustic ceiling tile. These have grids and tiles that can pop out and access the ceilings. The fixture are hanging and supported by the building.

Hard ceiling (drywall, gypsum), they are hard ceilings and the fixture is built specifically for this ceiling. 

## Sensor

Vacancy setting is when you need to manually turn on the lights, but it turns off automatically.

Occupancy is when it turns on automatically and turns off automatically.
