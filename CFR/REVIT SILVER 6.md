Copy/Monitor - SILVER TRAINING - 6

To place lighting fixtures in a pattern, go to Collaborate>Copy/Monitor>Select Link. Choose the link of the architectural link. Click copy and select the fixture and click to paste. OR check the multiple and then select everything. Use the filter to select only the light fixture. Then flick finish. Do it only for singular floors. Now, there is our architectural fixture on top of existing. 

Select all similar and then switch to CFR_TROFFERS or the one you want. All of them will be in the same direction, so you might want to rotate of them (shortcut spacebar) Change the 2x2s as well. Now you have put in lights that match the architecture. 

Tag all>Lighting Fixture Tags. Make some little adjustments.
