Telecom Systems Oveview - BRONZE TRAINING - T1

# Overview

Structure of a telecommunication system from the main telecommunication provider to end device.

There is a main service provider (Comcast/Verizon). 

The main system is normally in the general utility room and from there, distribute to other floors and telecom closets. 



We specify the wiring pathway for the IT equipment to support the Telecom system. A hole through the wall, device ring, and a back box.

These are the rooms on two different levels in the building. All the conduits run from telecom closets to telecom closets. May have cable trays carry all your cable throughout the facility. J hooks are little loops that can suspend wires.  

(View NIH CIT standards) In a room, there will be cable trays (cable management) overhead that goes into server racks.

# Telecom System Equipment

Main equipment and device utilized in a telecommunication system. This is what you will typically see in a telecom room.

- Fiber: Main feed enters your building from service provider provides phone, internet, cable. Lands onto server racks.
- Coax: distributes coax to tvs.
- Server Rack: goes to network switches. Grounded (green wire) to ground bar in the room. If no ground bar should be grounded to main electrical room. 
- Network Switch: distributes to switches throughout. 5000-10000 sqft (maximum you want to go in a data room). 300 feet maximum is the physical limit you want to run a data point back to a closet.
- Cable Tray: drops in on to server racks from overhead management. Cables also travel to other rooms.

A wire termination is the work performed to the end of a wire that allows it to connect to a device.

Connectors and cables include:

- CAT5 (100mbps). CAT5E (1000mbps), CAT6 Cable (10000mbps): Has to do with the thickness of the cable and therefore its transfer speed.  The blue jacket is for rating. Riser cables (grey) goes between floors. Surveillance cameras use ethernet cable. The jacket says what it is.
- Phone/Data Outlet
- Coax Jack(RG59 orRG6). Going to be obsolete. 
- Wireless Access Point - WIFI: a square/circle/rectangle to give WIFI throughout the building. Some routers may need a receptacle.

Covers plates can be mounted to a back box or device ring in the wall.

# Telecom and Security Sheets Overview

Data wiring diagram is the most robust way of showing the connections for cables. This is the cheapest way to run a data cabling for a wall device. No junction box nor conduits, just a device wing that the contractor cuts in the wall and inserts it in. Pulls a string through the box. Can terminate the cover plate and jacks in the wall. Offers the least protection. Called "device ring and pull string". If there is a insulated wall, you need an extra detail where there is a junction box and the conduit sub up 6 inches in the insulated space.

Sentence after wireless access point may be unnecessary. Phil chart is a good guideline.

Normally, telecom is on the power sheets. (like tenant) If there is a big job or specific request, then have dedicated T sheets.

## Grounding

Grounding is in the TIA EIA standards. Grounding paths you follow from telecom is similar to how grounding would work for electrical distribution.
