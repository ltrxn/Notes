Surface Metal Raceways and Lab Equipment - SILVER TRAINING - P2

# Surface Metal Raceway

A surface metal raceway (SMR) or Multi-Outlet Assemblies (MOA) are used to provide power where a high density of equipment and receptacle are needed, such as laboratories and group offices. There are is at least one receptacle every 24". 

Integral breaker (Wiremold 3000 is the only one that has them) and single/dual channel option (4000 don't have integral breakers) (basically a wall mounted conduit for circuits to run through). 

- A single has one channel
- A dual channel is one body with a divider separating data cable and low voltage.
- Should I use a 3000 or 4000? Put the same type of race way as existing. 3000: if you want access to the breaker by switching on and off. If it's new, put in non integral breaker and pull in individual circuits. 4000 are slimmer and smoother. 4800 are more popular and look sleeker.

Requirement found in section 10 in DRM (NIH Design Requirements Manual)

Limit to 4 per circuit. From the race way, it can be sub fed to under counter receptacles (EMT). Needs its own circuit breaker. 

If there's a switch it most likely controls the undershelf lights.

When you bring in many circuits through a conduit, you have to make sure you don't exceed the fill factor.

Should not be installed in wet locations. 6 feet away from showers, sinks, and doors. (Minimum 3ft and splash guard). Avoid putting receptacles 3 ft from shower. Have on GFI within 6 feet and put a weatherproof guard on it.

# Equipment Schedule

In laboratories, it's important to get architectural sheets. Architects had already ask client what they need. This sheet also has all the information about power needed. If it isn't filled out, request it early on in the job (should have by 35% to 50%).
