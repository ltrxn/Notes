ELECTRICAL SURVEYING - BRONZE TRAINING - P2

# Surveying

Prep work:

1. Have a kickoff meeting to see the drawings.
2. Talk about the scope of work.
3. Look at existing drawings. If there isn't remind PM. Build good relationship with building engineer.

It's good to see the whole floor plan even if you are working on a room. It's nice to have the existing floor plans and bring them on site (sometimes they can be digital). Need one-line diagram.

Bring: photo ID, keys, phone, get building engineer's cell phone number, drawing clip board with pencil/surface and pen, laser measurer, hear hat, ladder, flashlight,

On location:

1. Meet up with the building engineer at coordinated time. Request they take you to area of room and all the electrical closets on that floor. 
2. Find fire alarm control panel, generator. (can be coordinated ahead  of time to request they leave it unlocked).
3. Make sure the panel is unlocked.
4. Start in local electrical closet and check with one line diagram to ensure its accuracy.
5. General overall: Sketch out the room, measure the ceiling height just in case you need to add another subpanel/lighting control panel. Know how the one line works and things are distributed.
6. Get specifics about all the equipment in the electrical outlet. Record any panels and alarms. 
7. Take pictures of *everything*. Take one of the overview of the room, grab the room name, note the general location. Picture trail.
8. After general information, you need to zoom in and find out information about each equipment. Take pictures overview of the whole panel. Be consistent so when you review its understandable. Equipment nameplates, voltage bus ratings, breakers, and panel schedule (take 2). Overview the breakers (zoom close) capture its rating (AIC Rating). Transformers as well. 
9. Get building engineer's cell phone line.

Make a legend. You different colors.

Back at base:

1. Save everything to "site information" in the project's folder under a new folder named "[DATE in year month day] electrical survey [INITIALS]"
