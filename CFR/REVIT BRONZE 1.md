Revit - BRONZE TRAINING - 1	

# Project browser

Work in **sheets** 65% of the time. Main view.

Coordination view to see MEP General and panels. Second most used.

Views are based on discipline.

*To create a new view*, Views>Plan Views>Floor Plan>Choose floor plan to base off of.

Change the "discipline" to Electrical to gray out anything that isn't MEP.

Organize views further by changing "sub-discipline" to Power/Lighting/...

"Sheet, Working, or Backup View" can be On Sheet or Working  (annotations/tags only show up on the sheet you placed them on, but 3D elements do show up on all views.).

Rename floor plan to something better like "1st FLOOR PLAN - ELECTRICAL - POWER". Would you like to rename corresponding levels and views? "NO"

# Visibility

Click `v`. Under visibility, you see all the components you placed. You can also turn off an entire work set.

Sometimes, certain views are linked to each other. Or, background components need to be changed somewhere else. Go to "Revit Links" to change.

After placing an element, you might need to power it.

You can apply a visibility template. View>View Template. Apply a template, and then go back to \<none> so that you can customize it

# Work set

Put the components on a work set, or your layers, on the bottom middle or properties panel.

# View

**To Crop: **Properties>Extents Check "Crop View" and "Crop Region Visible" (to be able to see crop region). Move the box to a room/area. Uncheck ""Crop Region Visible".

**View from side:** Project Browser>Views>Architectural>Building Elevation>Elevation: North. Use this to find out the height of things.

**View Range** under properties of the floor range, you can change what range of height you see. 

Thick lines represent things you are cutting through. Think lines represents things you don't cut through (like chairs if you are viewing from 0' to 9').

# Phasing

Phasing affects how MEP elements show thickness wise. Says when it was created/demolished.

"Existing" would be something that already existed. (mostly used)

"New construction" would be something that will need to be built.

Use the working view to place all your existing conditions in. (*Do phases stick with each view?*)

# Template sheet

Move the labels around. 3 big things: notes (top right), floor plan(s), title (bottom left). Come together with Mechanical to discuss the layout.

Drag the views (1st floor plan) onto the template sheet. Pin it down. Line up the "COLUMN INTERSECTION A/1" on the top left corner of the floor plan. Click on the view, click viewport on the top of properties, and change the title to "CFR - WITH SCALE" Line up the title label with the title.

When you create a new sheet (Electrical sheets are under "E") grab the three dotted guidelines and labels. It acts as a guide line.

**To make new sheet**: Right click sheets>Click Okay. Change Drawing No and Drawing title. Notes come from Coordination>Electrical>Detail>Notes. Drag and drop them on the sheet. Each note can only go on one sheet, so you must duplicate them ("Duplicate with detailing"). Rename the note to the floor plan number. OR use legends if the notes are the same for every sheet. (You can place legends on more than one sheet).

Drag PLAN NOTES. It will display any key notes you make on the sheet. 

## Keynotes

To make a keynote Annotate>Keynote>User Keynote. This keynote will show up on plan notes. Finish the box of PLAN NOTES by clicking in the view and drawing lines with the style "Wide lines"

Go to keynotes setting to find where the text file is. Use Keynote manager (EINSTEIN/!Deploy/!2018 Revit Add-ons). 

# Tag Rooms

Architecture>Tag Room and do it individually, or Annotate>Tag All (TA) and check "Include elements from linked files" (to get the background). Use CFR_XXX Tag. 

# Print

Adobe PDF. Use separate file for certain projects. Choose "Select view/sheet" Look at only your sheets, and check the ones you need. Saved this set as "Mech 35% Schematic" (this is just an example). 

Choose setup.
