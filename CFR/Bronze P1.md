ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS OVERVIEW - BRONZE TRAINING - P1

# Electrical Distribution Overview

Starts from power plant. A step-up transformer steps it up to High Voltage (HV >100,000 V) to send over long distances. At a transmission substation, it steps it down to Medium Voltage (MV 1,000V to 100,000V). A distribution substation steps it down to Low Voltage (LV <1000V). Then, goes to the end user.

- High voltage reduces losses. Power = voltage*current. Power loss=current squared.

# Common System Voltages

## Low Voltage

480/277V Distribution System

- 480V, 3-Phase. There is an a, b, and c phase.
- 277V, 1-Phase. This is the voltage if you take one of the phases of the 3-phase and ground it. This is the voltage running through.

208/120V Distribution System

- 208V, 3-Phase
- 208V, 1-Phase. Only has a and b. Has 2 hots and a ground. No neutral
- 120V, 1-Phase

When we have a higher motors load, or kw rating, put it on the highest voltage system available, to maximize the power available. 

## Medium Voltage

4.1 or 13.2 or 13.8 kV

# Electrical equipment

- Switchgear: Very large equipment. Needed when over 3000 amps. Composed of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear faults downstream. Where electricity branches from.
- Switchboard. 800 amps - 2000 amps. Redirects electricity from source(s) to several smaller regions of usage. Where electricity branches from.
- Panelboard. An enclosure for overcurrent protection devices and divides electrical power feed into branch circuits. Types: larger *distribution* for motors and larger equipment (400-1200 amps) or *branch* circuit (~100 amps) panelboard.
- Transformer. To step down voltage within a building. Starts at 480/277V -->208/120V system.
- Disconnects. Has a lever for on/off. Has ratings on the box. Has 3 fuses. Every mechanical equipment has a fuse.
- Circuit breaker: "power circuit breaker" (800-1000amps) for  larger equipment.
- Wiring devices: switches, toggles, outlets. What the end user sees.

# Power Sheets

- E-001: General notes, symbols, abbreviations, and specifications.
  - Wiring notes and labeling details. 
- ED-100: Power Floorplans - Demolition
  - Existing conditions, what is going to be removed/salvaged/reinstalled.
  - When ever there is a floor plan, you must have a keyplan that shows the area of work, north arrow, and scale. Gave demolition plan notes and general notes.
- E-100: Power Floorplans - New Work
  - All new devices/equipment/power and show reconnection of salvaged equipment.
  - Have new work general notes and plan notes.
- E-500: Electrical Details
  - Details about how contractor should install equipment.
- E-600: One-Line Diagrams and Panel Schedules.
  - New work plan notes. Have load calculations.

# Specification Sheet

The left side should have the client's logo and all the contractors and architects. Make sure they are filled out on every sheet.
