FIRE ALARMS SYSTEM OVERVIEW - BRONZE TRAINING - FA2

# Fire Alarm System Overview

System all connected to a **Fire Alarm Control Panel**

Two types of systems:

1. Conventional (analog) system
   1. Initiative Device Circuits (IDC): The inputs, like smoke detectors, pull lever, etc., are looped together on this circuit.
   2. Notification Appliance Circuits (NAC): Speakers and strobes
   3. Signaling Line Circuits (SLC): power + data carried to Remote LCF Annunciator and Smart Relay Module.
   4. *There's also a telephone line that gets connected from the panel to the receiving station for the fire department*
2. Newer addressable (digital) system 
   1. Everything is done with a shingle power data SLC circuits. Everything is on the same wire going out and comes back.
   2. These are taking over because this system is modular and easily expandable. Becoming cheaper.

# Fire Alarm System Equipment

1. Fire Alarm Control Panel (FAC)
2. Remote Annunciator Panel
3. Power Extender Panel
   1. Let's you put additional devices on the circuit.
4. Fire Alarm Cable (Riser, Plenum, Shielded)

CFR layouts the devices and CFR puts in their specifications that a certified fire protection engineer submits the shop drawings where they calculate the voltage drop, how many systems can go on a wire, and the size of the wire. 

## Initiating Device

Initiating Device Circuit (IDC) on a single circuit.

- Manual pull station (F)
- Smoke detector (S)
  - Duct mounted smoke detector (SD)
- Duct smoke detector 

## Notification Devices

- Visual device "strobe" (V)
- Audible device "horn", "bell", or "speaker" (A/SP)
- Combination audible/visual (AV)

Each device has a candela rating, or the intensity the device will flash. 15 candela, 30 candela, etc. can be set on the device. There's a little white switch. During surveying, you should note down what it's set as.

# Typical Layouts and Code Requirements

Refer to **NFPA 72 - National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code**.

Tells you typical space in tenant fit-out for corridors, exit discharge (at grade and stairwells), open office and meeting rooms, electrical rooms, and elevator lobbies.

*how the code works* the IBC drives you to other code requirements > takes you to NFPA72 and N101>AHJ is your authority (any one has their own fire marshal is AHJ)
