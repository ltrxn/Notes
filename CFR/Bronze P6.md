# Contract Specifications.

## Construction Contracts

**Construction contracts**: A legally binding document that outlines the scope of work, risks, duties and legal rights of the contractor and the owner.

Construction Contract documents (order of legal hierarchy) (are legally blinding)

**Contract specifications**

- Provides details of the work, specific equipment and materials, and installation required to complete a project. It is the contractor's field guide on what materials to use, how to install them, and desired quality.

**Contract drawings**

- Visual representation of the scope of work.

- Includes plans, sections, elevations, measurements installation details, quantity and location of major equipment, and equipment schedule with ratings and performance requirements.

**Basis of design narrative.**

- An overview of the project's scope of work and reference to information used in the development of the contract specifications and contractor drawings.
- Includes scope of work, sizing/lighting/generator calculations (too prove things), product information (visual reference and examples to what a symbol means), shop drawings (actual dimensions of an actual equipment like a panelboard to show what the physical device would look like), and correspondences of design decision.
  - product cut sheets are general information and a shop drawing shows every specific dimensions and weight. That's why it's important to talk to the product reps so you can get ahead and get the general sizes and loads. They know the equipment better than we do. 
- The first thing the contractor might look at to get an idea of the project.
