# Self-publish an Arrangement

## The arrangement

Take a piece of music and arrange it to make it your own. Make sure that the music is from a public domain so that you do not infringe on anyone's copyrights. If you want to arrange copyrighted music, permission must be obtained from the copyright owner or print representative *prior* to starting your arrangement.

## What is the public domain?

The Public Domain is a record of works that are no longer under copyright protection. Once a copyright expires, it enters into the Public Domain.

So how can I tell when a song has entered a public domain?

- Music works voluntarily placed in public domain.

- Musical works was published in 1924 or earlier.
- 1925 and after: 70 years after the last surviving authorâ€™s death.
  - If published by a company, 95 years from publication or 120 years after its creation.
  - No post-1922 works will enter the public domain until January 1, 2019.

## Copyright for your arrangement

A copyright is a protection that gives the you the exclusive right to perform or display the work publicly, sell or distribute copies, makes copies of the work, and create derivative works of the song's arrangement. If another person uses, reproduces, sells, or performs the arrangement  without your permission, you can sue that person for infringement.

For song arrangements to be protected under U.S. copyright laws, they must satisfy the [following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102?_ga=2.33046270.1732000233.1591567871-1929185774.1591567871): 

- The arrangement must be an original work.
- It must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression, such as on sheet music or a digital recording.
- It must be a musical work, including any accompanying words.
- It must not be an idea or concept.

Your song is protected by copyright the moment you record it. Keep in mind that although you *own* your copyright, you have not actually *registered* it to the U.S. Copyright Office (costs money).

Another option is to register your song with commercial licensing agencies. Registering with these agencies is designed to help you sell licensed use of your song, but it still does not provide legal protection for your copyright.
