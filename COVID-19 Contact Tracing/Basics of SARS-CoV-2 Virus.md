## Origins of the virus

*Coronaviruses* (CoVs) are a large group of viruses that infect a wide range of mammals and birds. They regularly cause mild respiratory illness in people. 

*SARS-CoV-2* originated in bats. It jumped species to be able to be transmitted between humans. This is the third coronavirus: SARS (2002), MERS (2012), and now SARS-CoV-2 (2019). All were originated from bats.

## Signs and symptoms

SARS-CoV-2 causes the illness called *COVID-19* ("coornavirus disease that emerged in 2019").

Not every infected individual gets sick.

*Signs* are objective measurements to characterize illness during a physical exam: tempertature or breathing father than usual (because you can count breath/min). 

*Symptoms* are what patients say about how they feel that can't be objectively measured: fatigue, nausea, loss of taste or smell, or muscle ache.

​	Fever is both a sign and symptom.

Some one can be *asymptomatic* and have no symptoms and feel perfectly healthy, while some may have a mild disease, and others have more serious disease that can lead to death.

*Common signs and symptoms of COVID-19:* fever (>100.4 °F), tiredness, chills, muscle pain, cough, loss of taste or smell, difficulty breathing, headache, sore throat.

Many of these symptoms are *nonspecfic*, or common in other respirtory diseases. *Specific* symptoms for COVID-19 is the loss of taste or smell.

When the disease is *progressing* (becoming more severe) the patient has more severe fever and difficulty breathing. Immediately seek care if they have: blue lips/face, increased rate of breathing, chest pain, shortness of breath, waking up with shortness of breath, confusion, or difficulty waking up.

Effect of COVID-19 on lungs:

*Incubation period* is the time from when someone is infected until symptoms develop. SARS-CoV-2 incubation period ranges from 2-14 days. 50% become ill by 5 days.

*Infectious period* is the time when someone infected can transmit virus to other people. Begins 2 days before signs and symptoms to at least 10 days after onset of illness AND symptoms are improving AND no fever within past 3 days. Someoe is most infectious at day 1 of symptoms. Contagion lessens with time.

​	Asymptomatic can also be infectious.

## Risk factors

The following have increased risk: older age (>65 years of age), obese, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, heart disease, liver disease, kidney, weak immune system.

COVID-19 can kill when the lung cannot recoverer or when lack of oxygen damages organs in the body. Death is more common among older adults and rare among young and healthy people.

Currently, there is no *specific* treatement to cure. Treatment is to support the body's function until its immune system can fight the infection. 

​	Patients with lung disease require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.



## Diagonsis

- *Diagnostic tests* identify virus in the body. Called the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. A chemical reaction one in the lab to look for signs that the virus is reproducing in your cells.
  - Test on people with signs and symptoms. 
  - Swab taken from nose, throat or mouth. Saliva can also work.
  - Detects the RNA (genetic material) of the virus. Usually comes from somewhere in the respiratory tract.
  - A positive PCR test shows that there ar virus particles in the sample and there is an active infection. Some people do not have RNA in their sample, resulting in a false negative.
- *Antibody tests* identify antibodies to the virus in the blood. IgG antibodies can be identified after you recover as they are produced 10-14 days after infection. Antibodies are made by immunse system to fight off viruses or bacteria. Used to test for past infection.
  - Test performed on blood of someone who recovered or never had symptoms.
  - Positive IgG antibody test shows that you were infected in the past and could mean you have some protection from future SARS-CoV-2 infections (not confirmed).

No tests are perfect, so sometimes results are wrong.

## Transmission

1. Infected people have virus in mouths, noses, and throats. Droplets exit when talking, laughing, coughing, and sneezing and can enter another person's mouth, nose, or eyes.
2. Surfaces may have viruses from someone's respiratory droplets. Viruses can "survive" on surfaces and contaminate the hands of others. The hands can infect through mouth, nose, or eyes (why to handwash and clean!)

Droplets can travel up to 6 feet and land on someone's face or surface. Masks reduce transmission as fewer droplets leave from the infected person.

Transmission more likely to infect through physical contact, close contact, shared environment (offices and restaurants), sharing food and bathrooms, and sharing beds.

*Congrgate housing* are many people living in close quarteres like: prisons and jails, group homes, dormitories, and shelters. Nursing homes are at high risk for severe disease.

 *Reproductive number* (R0) is the number of people one infectious people will infect if everyone that person has contact with is susceptible. This is a good way to measure how fast a disease can spread.

COVID-19 R0 = 2 to 3. Each infected person infects two other people. By reducing R0 to 1, it can make a big difference.
