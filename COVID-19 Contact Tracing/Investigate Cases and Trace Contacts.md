## The basic steps

1. *Introduce yourself and get basic information*

   Identify who you are and your organization. Confirm their identity and residence since you will be discussing sensitive information. Discuss the positive test an ask if they've talked with their provider. Tell them how important and beneficial the call is. Confirm that its confidential. And let them know how long the call will be (20 minutes).

   Pause and assess the need for medical care if the person has trouble breathing, has cheast pain, confusion, or trouble talking.

2. *Inquire to figureout the case's infectious period*

   Ask when their symptoms start/have fever. Ask when they got tested. 

   Calculate the infectious period.

3. *Identify contacts during their infectious period*

   Any contacts will be quarauntined. Ask questions like "do you have any caretakers/housemates", "look at your calender to help job memory", "where did you go"

4. *Provide isolation instructions.*

   Explain isolation, ask questions to make sure they uderstand, identify challenges that may stop them from following isolation, offer resources.

   "Isolation means that you should try to eliminate contact with other people. If you live with others, you might try to find a different place to stay, or use your own bedroom and bathroom. If you need to be around other people, wear a mask."

5. Initiate contact tracing. Call case's contacts to ask about exposure, symptoms, and give quaranine instructions.

   Tell them they were in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Answer their questions and make a plan to follow up.

6. Check in with case and contacts when their isolation or quarantine ends.

   If they report new/worsening symptoms, calmly advise the individual to contact their health provider or call emergency medical services.

1-4 are achieved by calling the case. 5 calls the contacts. 6 is an on-going step with regular check-ins.
