## COVID-19 requires action

When a case of COVID-19 is diagnosed, the following actions must occur:. 

- *Support* the infected person.. They need access to medical care, social services, and offer treatment. Their contact with other people needs to be limited.
- *Identify* people they may have infected. Notify these people and offer them social services. If these people show symptoms, offer treatment. Those people should limit their contact with others because they would become infectious.

## Contact tracing

If we can limit contact between people who are infected and others, we can limit opportunities for the virus to be spread.

The goal of contact tracing is to find those an infected person may have contacted and ask them to stay at home so that they don't infect anybody else.

Preventing just one ase of COVID-19 can have a long-term impact on reducing the total number of cases.

## Defining a case and contact

*Case* is someone is confirmed to have COVID-19 by a positive laboratory test and can expose others.

â€‹	*Suspect or porbable case* is someone exposed to a case and develops symptoms, but has not had a test yet.

*Contact* is someone who had contact with a case while they were infectious. Three kinds of contact: within 6 feet for 15+ minutes, physical contact, or proximate contact (more than 6ft but in the same room for a long time). These people could be infected.

## Isolation and quarantine

*Isolation* means to keep sick people separate from healthy people. Restrict them to a home, hotel, or separate space in hospita to limit contact for the duration of infectiousness.

*Quarantine* restricts movement and contact of healthy people who have been exposed for 14 days since the last contact with the infected person.

Calculating how long a case should isolate and how long a contact should quarantine:

- A case should be isolated until they fully recover. Normally, at least 10 days after symptom onset and if symptoms have resolved. 
  - Example: you call the case on May 10. They became ill on May 9. They were infectious for 2 days before they became ill, and will continue to be for at least 10 days after their onset. 9+10 = 19. They should isolate themselves for 19 days if they have had no symptoms for 3 days. Ask about any contacts since May 7.
- A contact needs to stay in quarantine as long as they could be infectious. That is 14 days following the last contact with someone who is infectious (everyone will develop illness within 14 days, and for 14 days folowing the recoery of the case.
  - Example: you make a call to a contact on May 13. They tell you the last contact with the case was on May 10. They need to quarantine for 14 days since last exposure: May 10 + 14 days = May 24. 

## High-risk settings

Populations at increased risk:

- Dense contact environment (congrgate housing)
  - Large crowds of people or close interaction (physical or 6 ft) lead to "super-spreading" event (high reproductive number)
  - Examples: conferences, mass transit, religious services, workplaces, bars, gyms, school, events, concerts.
- Difficult to trace and identify exposures
  - Close contacts may be unknown, recall of contacts may not reliable, too many contacts.
  - Example: homeless shelter
- Difficult to isolate/quarantine
  - Design of house, disabilities, no resources, social pressures, or unwilling to cooperate.
  - Example: intermediate care facility.
- High risk of infection/severe disease or death.
  - More likely to get infected and have underlying medical conditions
  - Example: assisted living facilities.

Collect the location, type of interactions, contact information for venue, names of lose contact, specifics on flight number, movie/conference name, class name, facility name.

Notify case that there may be additional follow-up.

These situation should be immediately reported to your supervisor because they require extra special attention and effort to stop transmission.
