MONTH OF AUGUST

# August 1, 2020 (SE)

Today is when college applications open. I visited Common App and Coaltion websites and they prompted me to transfer my account to the 2021 application pages. While I did that, my heart raced as if I were nervous. I am seriously confused on whether I will get into any colleges other than University of Maryland. Just as I thought I wouldn't get into COVID-Corps, my current job, I think I won't get into Georgia Tech. However, lone and behold, I did get into COVID-Corps. It gave me so much hope. There are over 1000 applicants and a mere 130 applicants were hired. that is a 13% acceptance rate, and that's actually harder than Georgia Tech's 23%. Gives me hope that maybe I am competitive with my peers. I played multiple games of League of Legends, but it was really entertaining.

I did research on Georgia Tech and am planning to do it for every college. The most infuriating part is that information is so spread out and not from the source.

Watching a lot of "day in life" videos got me excited for college and further away from wanting to go to UMD.

My mom's friend's son goes to UW. I texted him asking him to describe what it's like there. I can tell from her eagerness to share that UW marked a very fun and exciting chapter of his life. He described UW as really vigorous and I know that he's a very hardworking guy. It's 30% acceptance rate makes it feasible and actually achievable. I will definitely be adding UW on the list, if they are on common app.

It's been 13 days and I guess I still haven't started my essay. Am I avoiding it on purpose because I know it'll suck? Maybe. I think by Saterday, I'm gonna force myself to write a very rough draft.

# August 14, 2020

Today during piano lessons, I started tearing up. It was the combination of the announcement of how many new songs I must learn and the mention of college. The tear could not be stopped. Ms. Yeh could probably hear the boredom in my playing. The songs took a lot of concentration and frankly, I was worn out.

After lessons, I cried fully. Snot, tears, and juices flowing out of all the holes on my face. I believe it can be worded as such: right now, I have the ability to determine the next four years of my life. I want so much, but my actions do not reflect it. I am afraid to start my essay for fear it will be terrible. What I write in these next three months can change my whole future. This extreme level of pressure causes more fear and therefore avoidance. 

There was this very inspirational quote on this typing speed test. I cannot remember it but it mentioned something about you must attempt before success. I must find it.

MONTH OF JUNE

# June 22, 2020 (PER)

I was going to start a spiritual journey and keep track of that, but I decided on just making a diary. I want to write about my day and feeling every single day this summer.

School ended last monday, and it's been a week. In order to not feel like I've wasted a week, I'd say I was just "recharging". Nows the time that I will start working (please keep me accountable). There are a few things on my mind: read up on the college admissions process, practice music, and read. Yesterday, I started reading Harry Potter after promising Abby to read it since last summer. I'm already half way done.

This morning, I had so much trouble getting downstairs to start my morning exercise. I tend to watch Youtube for a couple of hours. It's so easy to pause your brain, let it be absent. In the moment it feels so good, but after taking a peek at the clock, I'm hit hard with that realization that there's only 10 hours left in the day. However, it's still 10 hours! Yet, now it's time to go to bed and nothing was completed. I feel like this journal will also keep me working as I would need to reflect back on it. 

I applied to Covid Corps, a program that paid 14 dollars an hour with the goal of getting the community back to productivity. I heard from Isabel that they told a friend of hers that they were at "full capacity", and aren't accepting anyone new. I havn't recieved an email yet. Is it weird that I still have hope that I might get in?

I feel kind of lost. What should I be doing right now? I feel a little deflated. Bummed out that one of the biggest milestone of my early life, getting into a college, is here. I believe that I have control over what will happen (through essays), but I feel like this only opportunity of empowerment is going to impact my application negatively. My writing skills are not strong and I have struggled with finding my voice. What makes me, me? What do people see me as? I see people with such defined characters, their every action is predictable. I have strong beliefs, but they are easily swayed, so I don't know if it counts. Wish I had something definite.

# June 23, 2020 (SE)

Today, me and the fam were awakened to a box of live lobsters! For $130, 10 live lobsters were consumed by me (after they were cooked). I have not have lobster since summer 2019 at this super cool resturaunt where they cooked infront of us. In the afternoon, I went to Wotton Mill park to practice lacrosse and walked 3.8 miles. I was strangely extremely exhausted, probably due to an allergic reaction to the blazing HEAT. Made the mental confirmation to apply to a job ASAP. Today, I also finished Harry Potter book 1, so I've moved onto book 2. I am starting to enjoy reading fantasy again. It's even more entertiaining than watching YouTube. It's so hard to imporve at the game League of Legends. I have trouble seeing my mistakes because I watch so many tutorials and think to myself, I'm doing exactly what they are doing, but I probably am not. I need to focus more.

I took a speed reading test and scored 339 word per minute at 91% comprehension. I'm definitely going to take a speed reading computer program soon. I need to test myself again and compare the improvement. I heard you can practice your reading comprehension and therefore retain more knowledge. Also helps that I will be able to read faster.

Sophia told me to start speaking my mind. I noticed a lot that I harbor annoyance towards someone for doing something that I don't like. How can they know that they bother me if I don't tell them. For example, someone kept saying that "it's just normals, it doesn't matter" (league stuff). I really wanted to say "if you don't try then what's the point, you should always be seeking improvement". I don't know why I didn't want to say it. I think I didn't wanna seem weak or stuck up. I'm not quite sure with myself. Other times, I don't clearly state what I expect. I expect something, and when it doesn't happen, I get a little annoyed. However, I have no right to be annoyed. It's like being annoyed that no one gave me birthday wishes when I've kept my birthday a secret from everyone. Nice quotes "joke with each other and express yourself", "be confident", and "speak your mind".

# June 24, 2020 (ER)

Done with Harry Potter book two, a third of the way done with three. I played league for the entire second half of the day. That was the last straw for me. Too much time has been *wasted* away for a video game. I think about it so often, it's detrimental to myself. I deleted the game. Random thought: nothing is really fun and games. 

Moral question: are people too sensitive? As someone who has had uninvited feelings arrive at the wrong time, I'd say no. Just like everyone is entitled to their problems, your entitled to how you feel. Even if someone gets offended at something as absurd as the color red, they aren't considered "too sensitive". I think what people complain about is when that person burdens everyone around them and say, "no more red". This inconvenience wouldn't be a problem of the person being too "sensitive", but too "privileged". If they believe they are so special as to inconvenience someone else for their own comfort, then they think they should be treated more special. Often times, there is a particular something that is a well known symbol for something negative. Flaunting that symbol of negativity, causing people discomfort, does not mean that everyone is sensitive. Are you saying that nothing should offend you, verbal abuse or assult is okay since you are just "too sensitive". It's because to them, you just hurt them. Big jumble of words. I honestly, have found a lot of flaws in this logic. Maybe I'll come back to this another day.

Comparisonstmentalizing everything that is the source of my stress right here: college applications, piano, accomplishing nothing, finding a job, and time. This diary has slowed down time for sure. I can look back at the entries and see that each day something happened. My "what did I do today" paragraph looks awfully short, however. 

This is one of the days that are just blank. Even with the low amounts of motivation I have, this is the bottom of the canyon.

# June 25, 2020 (LSER)

First thing I did this morning was apply for two jobs. I applied to Bell's Nursery as a Garden Center Merchandiser. Right on their website, it states that I need a high school diploma, and I don't have one yet. Second job I applied to was to Argyle Country Club as a pool attendent. I hope I get this job. To be quite honest, I don't know if I'll be prepared to balance a job. Killing the ender dragon on the mincraft server we started for quarantine was supposed to be today, but was prosponed. I caught up with Abby, which reminded me that I have to practice her song so we can film a cinematic music video. So to end off my day, I spent a long time doing gradient nails. Super good combination is to have pink near the base to grey at the tips, creating  a muted french tip look.

I learned how to play volleyball today. It's so hard to control the ball and hit it with balance with both forearms. You have to tilt your entire body. There is so many parts of me that I have to focus on in order to perform a good bump or set. Isabel was my teacher and it happened to be the first time I met up with her since the begining of quarantine. Volleyball to me was awkward and new, but I'm willing to learn more.

I opened Counter Culture Big Trouble espresso blend coffee beans. It's just as sour as Intelligensia Black Cat, so I am getting a little worried. I need to lower the grind size and see what happens.

# June 26, 2020 (SE)

Waking up from a mere 7 hours of sleep, I drove down to South Gunners Branch Local Park to play tennis and volleyball with Rechelle, Felix, and James. I realized yesterday I was hitting the ball in the wrong spot! I also realized that I wasn't doing too bad in Tennis. My hand has gotten worse since yesterday. The popped blood vessel has bruised and it looks terrible. When I got home, I felt so tired and fatigued. My head was pounding and in pain. I thought I had corona for a quick minute, being careful not to cough and infect my family. Symptoms don't show on average for 5 days, so I knew it couldn't be right. My water did run out half way into our hangout, and I was so thirsty the whole time. Connecting two and two, I think I was dehydrated. I wanted to go to bed early because I felt so awful, but I stayed up to play league of legends with Kelly and her boyfriend, Cole. I deleted League just two days ago, but it's back already!

I haven't felt physical pain in a long time.

# June 27, 2020  (WCR)

Woke up today with no alarm. Immediately noticed just how fatigued I felt. My head still feels heavy from yesterday, although thankfully, much less. I practiced speed reading for an hour. Highest speed I can keep up with is around 800 wpm with minimal comprehension. While reading today, I've been making a meaningful effort to shut up that voice in my head. I really do need more practice. Funny realization: I type at 90 wpm, and while the human thought can reach speeds between 1000-3000 wpm, I think slower than I type sometimes. I made a pact with Julia to start Little Women today. Up to page 114 currently, and the language is so starkly different!
Georgia tech released their essay prompts, I should probably compile a list.

# June 28, 2020 (WLSCR)

Started the book Rich Dad Poor Dad, which is about financial literacy. Can't believe I called my friends from 8pm to 1am. 

# June 29, 2020 (PS)

First day of manual swap! Recording on a camera and phone simultaniously is extremely hard. I have this issues where I can't click the record button properly and we have to reenact the movement. Context: we are going to film a YouTube video and a tiktok. I hope that TikTok can get the exposure, and the YouTube version will be more informtionl
