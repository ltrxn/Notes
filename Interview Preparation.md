4. Have an answer to "Why you find CFR interesting"
   - I'm particularly interested in CFR because of you guys are MEP consultants utilizing mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, so I thought that I could I could gain a wide variety of experience by working for you guys. Adding on to that, I saw that you guys work with a large variety of clients, from resturaunts to offices, to technical labaoratory. I find the CFR's flexibility really admirable and interesting.

   - See first hand what it's like being an engineer
   - If it's possible, going to site visits and seeing the direct result of people's work.
   - Expand my knowledge on engineering! Even if I do well in my classes, I feel as if it's totally separate fr

   - 
7. Be able to share a time that made you want to focus on working in the engineering field (I designed ______ while in AP Computer Science, I learned about this program "___________" and I want to learn more, I know someone who is an engineer and I am so enthralled by what they do...)
8. Be honest about time commitments (if you plan on also doing a sport or president of a club) - be realistic about the need to be really good at time management
