I was going to start a spiritual journey and keep track of that, but I decided on just making a diary. I want to write about my day and feeling every single day this summer.

School ended last monday, and it's been a week. In order to not feel like I've wasted a week, I'd say I was just "recharging". Nows the time that I will start working (please keep me accountable). There are a few things on my mind: read up on the college admissions process, practice music, and read. Yesterday, I started reading Harry Potter after promising Abby to read it since last summer. I'm already half way done.

I applied to Covid Corps, a program that paid 14 dollars an hour with the goal of getting the community back to productivity. I heard from Isabel that they told a friend of hers that they were at "full capacity", and aren't accepting anyone new. I havn't recieved an email yet. Is it weird that I still have hope that I might get in?

This morning, I had so much trouble getting downstairs to start my morning exercise. I tend to watch Youtube for a couple of hours. It's so easy to pause your brain, let it be absent. In the moment it feels so good, but after taking a peek at the clock, I'm hit hard with that realization that there's only 10 hours left in the day. However, it's still 10 hours! Yet, now it's time to go to bed and nothing was completed. I feel like this journal will also keep me working as I would need to reflect back on it. 

I feel kind of lost. What should I be doing right now? I feel a little deflated. Bummed out that one of the biggest milestone of my early life, getting into a college, is here. I believe that I have control over what will happen (through essays), but I feel like it's such a restricting factor. My writing skills are not strong and I have struggled with finding my voice. What makes me, me? What do people see me as? I see people with such defined characters, that every action is predictable. I have strong beliefs, but they are easily swayed, so I don't know if it counts.
