## Literary Techniques

Four effects in their writing.

Theme (overall message a written work conveys)

Characterization (the descriptions and personality traits)

Mood (atmosphere or the feeling the text gives the reader)

Tone (the author's or speaker's attitude towards something)

Analogy: a comparison between two things. 

- Conceit: a very imaginative drawing of an analogy that continues for the entire work.
- Metaphors: a comparison between two things
- Smile: a comparison between two things using like or as.



Synecdoche (sin-ec-doh-kee): a type of symbolism in which *a part* of a thing represents the thing itself.

- "I need all **hands** on deck." The hand does not represent just the hand, but the entire person. It is used to emphasize the part. Hand would represent the work and labor.
- Ed's friend was in the market for new set of **wheels**. The wheels would represent the whole car. Emphasis on wheels because a car gets places.



Metonymy: a figure of speech in which one thing is represented by another that is *associated* with it. 

- The "White House" made the decree. White house is just related to the entire government.



Oxymoron: a figure of speech which combines contradictory words and meanings for special effect. Two **words** next to each other. Authors can put too vastly different things and it emphasizes how much they differ.

Paradox: a statement that seems contradictory on the surface, but both statements are actually true. These are **ideas**.



Euphemism: a mild word/phrase which substitutes for another word that would be too direct.

- "she passed away"

Hyperbole: a purposeful exaggeration

- Shampoo adds amazing luster to your hair for infinite shine.

Puns: a play on the sound of two words or words that have the same meaning. Draws emphasis and creates character.



Apostrophe: a form of direct address; character/author addresses an absent person or a personified thing.

- Twinkle twinkle little stars, oh how i wish you were here.



Irony.

- Dramatic irony: audience knows something that the characters don't know. Makes the reader want to keep reading because we wait for them to figure it out.
- Situational irony: there's an expectation, but the opposite happens.
- Verbal irony: sarcasm.



Sound devices:

- Alliteration: repetition of the same consonant sounds at the beginning of word.
  - "The guys grimaced and groans".
  - But why is this used? It amplifies things and you can assume its over done.
- Consonance: neighboring words repeat the same consonant sound, but not at the beginning. 
  - "little sitter" The t's are the consonants.
- Assonance: the repetition of internal *vowel* sounds usually close together for aesthetic or humorous effects.
  - "fish and chips"3
- Onomatopoeia: any word that sounds like what it names.
  - "whisper" and"hush". Whisper as the ssspp sound.

## Complex sentence types

- Cumulative sentence: a sentence that begins with a standard sentence pattern and adds multiple details after it. It gives the main idea first, and the details after. 
  - â€‹	Gets to the point first.
- Periodic sentence: a sentence that begins with multiple details and holds off a standard sentence pattern until the end of the sentence.
  - Creates suspense
- Inverted sentence: a sentence that has the verb appear before the usbject

## Sentence types

- Declarative sentence: a sentence that states a fact or an argument and ends with a period.
- Interrogative Sentence: a sentence that asks a direct questions and always ends in a question mark



### Parallel structure and antithesis

- Parallelism: balance in syntactical expression; repeated grammatical patterns in phrases.

- Antithesis: a figure of speech in which one term is balanced against another for emphasis. (both side must be balanced in sentence and idea)
  - That's one small step for man, and one big step for mankind"

## Language

Abstract language are more flowery and harder to understand.

Concrete language is easy to understand.

Connotation: what a word means to us versus what its literal definition is. Two words that describe the same thing can make the reader feel differently.

Motif: a repeated image, phrase, description in a work of literature.

## Grammar

Semi-colons: used to join two complete sentences that are related to each other. Anytime you use a semi-colon you should be able too use a period. It's all about style.

"Brandi helped her sister ride her bike; therefore, her sister helped Brandi bake a cake."
