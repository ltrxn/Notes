10/12: Writing Literary Essays

# Introductory Paragraph

**Broad Generalization**: Establish the subject matter in a universal way (1-2 sentences)

- "Guilt has a way of gnawing at people's consciences until it consumes them."

**Transition:** Introduce title, author and provide context for the reader (1-3 sentences)

- Answer the prompt: "In *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini,the protagonist, Amir, spends most of his life seeking for the love of his emotionally distant father. This need for his father's attention leads him to sacrifice his friendship with his servant, Hassan, by betraying him after the kite running tournament; this leads to a lifetime of regret."

**Thesis statement:** Provides your specific answer to the prompt. Asserts your claim. (1-2 sentences)

- In the scene where Amir desires Hassan to hit him with pomegranates, Hosseini's literary devices highlight Amir's condescending, yet meek character, and portray a character wracked with guilt. 

# The Body Paragraph

**Topic sentence:** Introduce the overall point of the paragraph (1 sentence)

- "In the beginning of the story, Myop is naïve about the vicious nature of her racist society, and Walker explores her innocence through literary techniques. "

**Examples, quote, explanation, analysis:** Provides your evidence for making your point. Integrate and cite quotes. (Many sentences).

- "Myop is young--full of excitement and quiet anticipation.   Her whole world revolves around images of “pretty ferns and leaves, an armful of strange blue flowers, and a sweet suds bush” (Walker 15).  The beauty of nature in her own territory amazes her as the “days had never been as beautiful as these” (Walker 10). She feels “light,” “good,” and “warm” which reflect her immaturity and youth (Walker 11). Her life is free of any priorities, worries, or responsibilities, and “nothing exist[s] for her but her song” (Walker 12). This hyperbole represents her naiveté as she focuses on her own pleasurable activities without thinking about the outside world. However, as she begins to become more curious, she breaks from the tradition of “gather[ing] nuts among the fallen leaves” with her mother, and “she [makes] her own path” (Walker 14). The “path” symbolizes her growing independence and need to satisfy her curiosity. Gradually, her discoveries take her “a mile or more from home,” which only leads to increasing tension and trouble as the mood of the story shifts and becomes darker (Walker 16)."
- No where does it say "the first technique the author use is...". Don't make a paragraph on each technique.

**Conclusion sentence:** Restate the overall point AND ties that example back to your thesis (1 sentence). 

- "Therefore, Walker’s language underscores Myop’s gradually disappearing naiveté as her growing independence and curiosity lead her to discover new perspectives on the reality of the world." 

# Conclusion Paragraph

**Restate thesis:** Remind the reader of your overall argument and assertion (1-2 sentence).

- Ultimately, the author's literary device all work together to create an incredibly complex character. Rachel is at times mature and thoughtful, and other times childish and impulsive. Through Rachel, Cisneros is able to accurately portray the confusion and intricacy of adolescence. In doing so, the author reminds all readers of a difficult and exciting life, and urges adults to remember the struggles that go along with that age. Adults should not minimize the ideas and feelings of children, and reading Rachel's anguish helps argue that those in power have a  responsibility to let all voices be heard. In that sense, "Eleven" is a story that speaks to the racial, economic, and gender disparities in today's society.

**The Big Idea:** Leave the reader with a lesson either the character, author, or reader takes away from your analysis. Make a sophisticated connection between the text and the broader realities of the world (2-4 sentences).
