1. **What's an object that people associate with you?**

   People at school may associate me with my pencil pouch. When people turn their heads towards me, they see the blue silicone tube with a zipper always on my desk. I've noticed so many people reach out to touch it like everyone instinctively want to prod at slime. I have a special connection with my stationary. I can remember where I get every item and it kind of represents me in the way that I love quality. When collecting things, I'd rather grow my collection slowly, taking the time to research everything. I initially met this pouch in Taiwan at a bookstore. My eyes had been searching for a small pouch that held around 5-6 pencils, no more than that. I wanted it to be small so that I can make a concious effort to carry around my most bread and butter stationary items. As i mentioned before, quality over quantity. This pouch is seen by other people as strange but super "cool". I smile at that thought. It really fits me as I approach things with precision and care. Precision and organization are both represented by that object.
